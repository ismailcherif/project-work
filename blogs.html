          <h2>Some Tips For Young Photographers</h2>
          <ul>
        <h3><b> Use the Rule of Thirds</b></h3> 
        <h3><b> Avoid Camera Shake</b></h3>
        <p>
          This rule helps you take eye-catching pictures by using one of the most effective rules of composition.
          <br>
         If you want to take pictures that have a “wow” factor built in them, the Rule of Thirds is the composition secret you need to take advantage of!
          <br>
         To use the rule of thirds, imagine four lines, two lying horizontally across the image and two vertical creating nine even squares. Some images will look best with the focal point in the center square, but placing the subject off-center at one of the intersecting points of the imaginary lines will often create a more aesthetically composed photograph.
          <br>
         When a photograph is composed using the rule of thirds the eyes will wander the frame. A picture composed using the rule of thirds is usually more pleasing to the eye.

        <h3><b>Learn to use the Exposure Triangle</b></h3>
        <br>
        <p>Camera shake or blur is something that can plague any photographer and here are some ways to avoid it.

       First, you need to learn how to hold your camera correctly; use both hands, one around the body and one around the lens and hold the camera close to your body for support.

       Also, for handheld shooting, make sure that you are using a shutter speed that is appropriate for your lens’ focal length. If you’re shutter speed is too slow, any unintentional movement of the camera will result in your entire photograph coming out blurry.

          <h1>Kung Fu</h1>
            Kung Fu, an ancient sport popular in China, has a very long history, during which a variety of skills were created and massively improved. 
          <br>
          Originated from the hunting and defense needs in the primitive society (over 1.7 million years ago – 21st century BC), it at first only included some basic skills like cleaving, chopping, and stabbing. 
          <br>
        Later the system of Kung Fu formed and developed mainly as the fighting skills from the Xia Dynasty (21st - 17th century BC) to the Yuan Dynasty (1271 - 1368), and reached its peak during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368 - 1911). 
        <br>
      In modern times, it develops well and becomes not just martial skills or physical movement. It is also a way for keeping fit, entertainment, and performance.</p>
